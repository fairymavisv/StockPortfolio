# Stock Portfolio Project - Re COMP3900
## Introduction

Welcome to the `Stock Portfolio` project, a comprehensive full-stack application designed as part of the undergraduate course COMP3900. This project serves not only as an academic endeavor but also as a personal journey of redemption and technical improvement.

## Project Overview

During the initial phase of the project, our aim was to create a robust platform where users could manage and analyze their stock investments effectively. The application was intended to incorporate various features including portfolio management, stock market insights, and predictive analytics to forecast stock performance.

## Personal Reflection and Redevelopment

Despite the collective effort and dedication, my personal contribution to the stock prediction feature fell short of the project's standards due to an oversight on my part. Recognizing this as a pivotal learning opportunity, I have decided to revisit and revamp the prediction module. This decision is fueled by a desire to rectify past mistakes and to deliver on the promise of a fully functional stock prediction tool.

## Current Endeavors

I am currently in the process of rewriting the stock prediction feature from the ground up. This entails:

- Re-evaluating the data sources and ensuring they are robust and reliable.
- Implementing advanced analytical algorithms with a focus on accuracy and efficiency.
- Conducting thorough testing to ensure the predictions are as accurate as possible.
- Integrating the new prediction model seamlessly with the existing full-stack infrastructure.

## Objective

The goal is not only to enhance the functionality of the Stock Portfolio project but also to overcome the challenges I previously faced. This act of revisiting the project symbolizes my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

## Conclusion

The Stock Portfolio project, in its renewed form, aims to stand as a testament to the idea that setbacks are not the end but rather the catalysts for growth. Stay tuned for updates as I work towards turning this vision into reality.

Thank you for your interest and support!
